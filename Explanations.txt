Addition Using the Associative and Commutative Properties:
We can employ mathematical properties to simplify the addition of numbers. Let's break down the problem 45 + 50 step by step:


1. Associative Property:
45 + 50 = 40 + 5 + 50


2. Commutative Property:
Group the tens together to make the addition process easier:
( 40 + 50 ) + 5


3. Combine the Tens:
90+5


4. Complete the Addition and Add 5:
95










































Subtraction using the Distributive and Commutative Properties
We can employ mathematical properties to simplify the addition of numbers. Let's break down the problem 84 - 37 step by step:


1. Distributive Property:
84 − 37 = ( 80 + 4 ) − 37


2. Commutative Property:
= 80 + ( 4 − 37 )


3. Subtraction:=30
= 80 +( 4 − 30 − 7 )


4. Commutative Property:
= ( 80 − 30 ) + 4 - 7


5. Combine Like Terms:
           = 50 + 4 - 7


6. Complete the Subtraction 
= 47
































Multiplication of single-digit numbers
We can employ mathematical properties to simplify the multiplication of single-digit numbers. Let's break down the problem 8 x 9 step by step. 


1. Draw 8 circles. In each circle, write the number 9.
  



2. To find your answer, add up the number of 9’s that you count in every circle. In this case, this would be eight 9’s. 
9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 =


3. Notice how adding two 9's together results in 18. Continue grouping until you reach your final result:
18 + 18 + 18 + 18 =
36 + 36  =


4. Final result 
72






















Division with dividends and divisors. 
We can employ mathematical properties when dividing double-digit numbers by single-digit numbers.  Let's break down the problem 72 ÷ 8 step by step:


1. Think of 72 as 8 groups:
Ask yourself, "How many groups of 8 can I make with 72?" In other words, you're finding out how many times you need to add 8 to itself to reach 72.


2. Keep adding 8 until you get 72:


8 + 8 = 16 (2 times) 
16 + 8 = 24 (1 time) 
24 + 8 = 32 (1 time) 
32 + 8 = 40 (1 time) 
40 + 8 = 48 (1 time) 
48 + 8 = 56 (1 time) 
56 + 8 = 64 (1 time) 
64 + 8 = 72 (1 time) 


3. Now add the number of times
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 =


4. The amount of times you got it represents your answer. Therefore, your answer is 
= 9
